 a popular data visualization library, in a local environment without an active internet connection. This means you can create and interact with interactive charts and graphs without relying on an internet connection to load external resources.

To perform offline testing with Plotly, you typically follow these steps:

Install Plotly: Make sure you have Plotly installed in your Python environment. You can install it using a package manager like pip.

Copy code
pip install plotly
Import Plotly: In your Python script or Jupyter notebook, import the necessary modules from Plotly.

python
Copy code
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
Create and Customize Your Plot: Use Plotly to create the desired plot or chart. You can create a variety of charts, including scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, and more.

python
Copy code
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3, 4], y=[10, 11, 12, 13], mode='markers')])
Save and View the Plot: To view the plot offline, you can use the write_html or write_image functions provided by Plotly. This will generate an HTML file containing the plot.

python
Copy code
fig.write_html('offline_plot.html')
You can then open the HTML file in a web browser to interact with the plot.

Interact with the Plot: When you open the HTML file, you'll be able to interact with the plot just like you would in an online environment. You can zoom in, hover over data points for information, and perform other interactive actions.

Optional: If your plot relies on external resources, such as custom JavaScript code or CSS styles, make sure to include those resources in your local environment as well.

Offline Plotly testing is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to generate and interact with plots in environments without internet access, such as in secure or air-gapped systems.
